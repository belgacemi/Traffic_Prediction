The following models were developped in order to solve the problem at hand:
	* LSTM
	* Feed Forward Network
	* Random Forest Regression
	* Gaussian Process
	* Support Vector Regression 

In term of results, the Random Forest Regression model gave the best Mean Squared Error [MSE] values.
The other models were dropped at the end stage, and the final work was further developped using the best performning model.
